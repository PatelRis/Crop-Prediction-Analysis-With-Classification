<p style="font-size:18px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em">Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em">Machine learning is everywhere throughout the whole growing and harvesting cycle. It begins with a crop prediction — from the soil preparation, seeds breeding and water feed measurement — and it ends when robots pick up the harvest determining the ripeness with the help of computer vision.</p><br>
