<p style="font-size:18px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em">Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-family:verdana; line-height: 1.7em">Machine learning is everywhere throughout the whole growing and harvesting cycle. It begins with a crop prediction — from the soil preparation, seeds breeding and water feed measurement — and it ends when robots pick up the harvest determining the ripeness with the help of computer vision.</p>

In the crop recommendation, the user can provide the parameters like 𝑵-𝑷-𝑲, 𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆, 𝒉𝒖𝒎𝒊𝒅𝒊𝒕𝒚, 𝒑𝑯 𝒗𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆, 𝒓𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒇𝒂𝒍𝒍 & 𝒄𝒓𝒐𝒑 from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

• 𝑵𝒊𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒈𝒆𝒏 (𝑵) – Nitrogen is largely responsible for the growth of leaves on the plant.<br>
• 𝑷𝒉𝒐𝒔𝒑𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒖𝒔 (𝑷) – Phosphorus is largely responsible for root growth and flower and fruit development.<br>
• 𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒖𝒎 (𝑲) – Potassium is a nutrient that helps the overall functions of the plant perform correctly.<br><br>
